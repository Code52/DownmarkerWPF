# DownmarkerWPF

This codebase contains the [DownmarkerWPF](http://code52.org/DownmarkerWPF/) project, by [Code52](http://code52.org/)

## About DownmarkerWPF

MarkPad (formerly known as DownmarkerWPF) is an editor for [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) - a widely used syntax for formatting plain text to convert to blogs, comments, and in other places like on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).

Our aim is to create a useably, stylish new version of the project utilising Microsoft's WPF technology to provide a fresh UI for creating files that we can use to create blog posts for this, and other blogs using Markdown.

## Dependencies

 - Windows 7 (please provide feedback if you encounter issues with Vista, XP or Windows 8)
 - .NET Framework 4.0 (should install if you don't already have it on your machine)

## Tools required to develop

 - Visual Studio 2010
 - WiX - to generate the installer (optional)
