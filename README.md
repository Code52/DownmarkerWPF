# DownmarkerWPF Ex

This codebase contains a fork of the [DownmarkerWPF](https://github.com/Code52/DownmarkerWPF) project. 

## About DownmarkerWPF Ex

Downmarker is an editor for Markdown - a widely used syntax for formatting plain text to convert to blogs, comments, and in other places like on Stack Overflow.

Our aim is to create a useably, stylish new version of the project utilising Microsoft's WPF technology to provide a fresh UI for creating files that we can use to create blog posts for this, and other blogs using Markdown.

This fork replaces the hard coded NLog and Autofac support with the NuGet available libraries [Caliburn.Micro.Logging](https://github.com/dbuksbaum/Caliburn.Micro.Logging) and [Caliburn.Micro.Autofac](https://github.com/dbuksbaum/Caliburn.Micro.Autofac)
