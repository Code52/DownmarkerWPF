# DownmarkerWPF

This codebase contains the DownmarkerWPF project. 

## About DownmarkerWPF

Downmarker is an editor for Markdown - a widely used syntax for formatting plain text to convert to blogs, comments, and in other places like on Stack Overflow.

Our aim is to create a useably, stylish new version of the project utilising Microsoft's WPF technology to provide a fresh UI for creating files that we can use to create blog posts for this, and other blogs using Markdown.
